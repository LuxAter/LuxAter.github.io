This website has been constructed using [Gatsby](gatsbyjs.org) and styled with
[Skeleton](getskeleton.com). The styling was further customized, and all the
source code can be found in the github repo.

All of the pages are written in markdown, and the content is automatically
generated into the html through the use of the gatsby-remark plugin.

| I am continually developing and improving this website, so things may change.
