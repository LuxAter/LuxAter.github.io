Lexici is a collection of problems implemented in a variety of different
languages. The problems are sourced from [Project
Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Using this data set of programming languages
constructed using the same algorithm for the same problems allows for
interesting comparisons between the different languages. 

This can be used as a reference to compare implementation of the same algorithm
across a number of different programming languages, allowing for better
understanding of a new language.

Using the timed results of the executable, and the bytes of code required to
achieve equivalent algorithms, we assign an efficiency metric. This is a rough
approximation of the lines of code required related to the execution speed of
that language.

It is note worthy that each language is suitable for different tasks, and thus
a language may be extremely well suited for one problem, but may require much
more work and time on other problems. This is merely a general comparison of
how each language fairs against a variety of problems.

## Problems ##

Each problem has its own dedicated page, with an explination of the logic.

## Languages ##

The currently implemented languages are the following
