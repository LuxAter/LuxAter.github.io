> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
> two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first 10 terms will be:
> $$
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \ldots
> $$
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
> four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Solution

A direct method would be to calculate every Fibonacci number, and if it is
even, then we add it to a running sum, only if it is even.

This can be improved upon. It becomes clear that every third Fibonacci number
will be even. This means that we can skip all the odd numbers, so that only
every third number is added.

The pseudocode of the final solution is
```
limit=4000000
sum=0
a=1
b=1
c=2
while c < limit
  sum=sum+c
  a=b+c
  b=c+a
  c=a+b
Output sum
```

### Code

%%%

C++
```cpp
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int limit = 4000000;
  int sum = 0;
  int b = 1;
  int c = 2;
  if (argc > 1) {
    limit = atoi(argv[1]);
  }
  while (c < limit) {
    sum += c;
    int a = b + c;
    b = c + a;
    c = a + b;
  }
  std::cout << sum << std::endl;
}
```
