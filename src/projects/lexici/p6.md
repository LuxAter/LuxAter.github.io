> The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
> $$
> 1^2+2^2+\ldots+1-^2=385
> $$
> The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
> $$
> (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
> $$
> Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
> numbers and the square of the sum is $3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640$. Find the difference
> between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and
> the square of the sum.

### Solution


### Code

%%%

C++
```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int limit = 100;
  if (argc > 1) {
    limit = atoi(argv[1]);
  }
  int sum = limit * (limit + 1) / 2;
  int sum_sq = (2 * limit + 1) * (limit + 1) * limit / 6;
  int diff = pow(sum, 2) - sum_sq;
  std::cout << diff << std::endl;
}
```
